## What is system design?

Before we start this course, let's talk about what even is system design.

System design is the process of defining the architecture, interfaces, and data
for a system that satisfies specific requirements. System design meets the needs
of your business or organization through coherent and efficient systems. It requires
a systematic approach to building and engineering systems. A good system design requires
us to think about everything, from infrastructure all the way down to the data and how it's stored.

### Why is System Design so important?

System design helps us define a solution that meets the business requirements. It is
one of the earliest decisions we can make when building a system. Often it is essential
to think from a high level as these decisions are very difficult to correct later. It
also makes it easier to reason about and manage architectural changes as the system evolves.
